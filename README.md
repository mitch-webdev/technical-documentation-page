## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- The layout should have the navbar on the left hand side on laptop/desktop devices. On smaller devices, the navbar should then place itself over the main content.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project taught a lot in terms of HTML semantics and how to structure all HTML elements, all while learning about Linux at the same time. Really enjoyed making this one.

### Useful resources

- [Ubuntu Website](https://ubuntu.com/) - This helped me writing text in this project.
- [Linux Training Academy](https://www.linuxtrainingacademy.com/) - This is an amazing teacher which helped me understand more on Linux OS. I'd recommend it to anyone learning about Linux.
